      I am a research scientist at <a href="https://www.antresearch.com/" target="_blank">Ant Group Research Institute</a>.
      I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. <a href="http://xzhou.me/" target="_blank">Xiaowei Zhou</a>.
      I earned my bachelor's degree in Automation from Zhejiang University, where I also minored in ACEE at the Chu Kochen Honors College.
      <p></p>
      My research lies at the intersection of 3D computer vision and embodied intelligence. 
      I focus on reconstructing and generating human-like agents, aiming to accurately capture human interactions with the physical world and to develop agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in real-world environments.
